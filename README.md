This repo is for a robotic car project I am doing on my own

I plan to gradually give the vehicle automated characteristics


Step 1: Make it functional

  1.1: Assembling and mounting crucial comps

  1.2: connecting power source(s)

  1.3: Making Arduino connections

  1.4: Uploading simple iterated code


Step 2: making it controllable
  
  2.1: make it wireless

  2.2: make it responsive


Step 3: giving it senses 
  
  3.1: spacial awareness and obstacle detection
  
  3.2: environmental awareness
  
  3.3: visual awareness
  
  3.4: making it multiaxially drivable


Step 4: g√≠ving it autonomy
  
  4.1: Object and obstacle detection
  
  4.2: AI model training*

  
  *Things I know of but have very little idea how to execute
