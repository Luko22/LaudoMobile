This repo is for a robotic car project I am doing on my own

I plan to gradually give the vehicle more features, hoping to eventually get to autonomy


Step 1: Make it functional

  1.1: Assembling and mounting crucial comps

  1.2: connecting power source(s)

  1.3: Making Arduino connections

  1.4: Uploading simple iterated code


Step 2: Make it drivable tethered 

  2.1: attach joystick
  
  2.2: make it responsive

  2.3: make it drivable

Step 3: Make it wirelessly drivable

  3.1: pick and use wireless communication medium
  
  3.2: Create controller
  
  3.3: allow controller ot transmit and vehicle to receive


Step 4: giving it senses 
  
  4.1: spacial awareness and obstacle detection
  
  4.2: environmental awareness
  
  4.3: visual awareness
  
  4.4: making it multiaxially drivable


Step 4: g√≠ving it autonomy
  
  4.1: Object and obstacle detection
  
  4.2: AI model training*

  
  *Things I know of but have very little idea how to execute
